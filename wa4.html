<h2 id="title">Why the Clone Wars is the Best Star Wars Content</h2><br>


<p>     Star Wars the Clone Wars, the TV show originally released in 2008 is truly the apex of Star Wars content. When the Star Wars prequel era was first unveiled under the prequel trilogy between 1999-2005, it was widely reviled. It was George Lucas and Dave Filoni, the creators of the Clone Wars animated TV show, that helped turn an entire generation of Star Wars fans towards appreciating the prequels for all of their flaws and glory. 
</p> 

<p>     George and Dave accomplished this by expanding on the story of Anakin Skywalker and more clearly showing how and why he succumbed  to the dark side. There is a clear difference in format between cinema and television, and this difference is no more starkly presented than the difference between the prequel movies and the Clone Wars. In cinema you only have around 2 hours to tell a story and perhaps you get a trilogy to build a character arc. With a TV show, there is essentially limitless room for character development. The format of TV allows for the slow burn of a character arc, rather than the crash and burn of a blockbuster flick. The Clone Wars expands on Anakin’s tensions with the Jedi council, his mentoring by Palpatine, and how the relationship with the women in the life ( his wife and apprentice) impact his devotion to the Jedi order, and ultimately how war makes monsters out of otherwise good men. 
</p>

<p>     Other than what this show has meant for fans such as myself, this show has been viable in a commercial sense. The Clone Wars originally aired on Cartoon Network and was the highest watched series premiere in the network’s history. The show was originally cancelled when Disney bought Lucasfilm. However, last summer the show was renewed for a final 7th season and for the  first half of 2020 it was the “the third-highest in digital original streaming content (behind only Stranger Things and Mandalorian, way ahead of series like Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico, The Witcher, and Tiger King, and CBS’s Star Trek: Picard) and the tenth-highest overall streaming series in terms of demand expressions”. Apparently, Clone Wars not only beat out the Mandalorian but also “no other series reached the peak level of viewing in one week as Clone Wars” in 2020 while maintaining an average rating of 8.3 on IMDB. 
</p>

<p>In conclusion, Star Wars the Clone Wars is not only a series that has won over the hearts of fans, but has also proved itself to be a viable commercial venture for Disney. Disney has recognized this success and is currently producing a Clone Wars spinoff, The Bad Batch, to be released this summer.
