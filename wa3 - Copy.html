<h2>Weekly Assignment #3</h1><br>
<p>     For a while now within the recent history, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">/r/WallStreetBets</a> has been using their platform to largely show off and explore their exploits on the stock market. Most of the the users on the subreddit used Robinhood and other <a href ="https://investorplace.com/2021/01/robinhood-bans-reddit-stocks-wallstreetbets-gme-cciv-sndl-jagx-amc-nok-bb/"> previously consumer friendly stock brokerages</a>, which often had 0% commissions on trades, towards their stock market exploits. A lot of the users simply used the subreddit to either brag or remiss on their gains or losses. In regards to the recent news, one of the subredditors discovered that the majority of shares held for GamesStop <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GME:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiuyuzS5-LuAhWZB80KHe1EAH8Q3ecFMAB6BAgDEBk">(GME)</a> were overleveraged in that most of the investors did not actually own the shares. In that most of the investors had short positions. This means that they loaned the shares and then expected the price of the shares to drop, resulting in a profit should the shares actually drop in price. However, a /r/Wall Street Better realized this and decided to embark on a short squeeze. This is where should the share prices rise, and the investors who engaged in short positions are essentially forced to buy back the shares to cut their losses and result in the price of the stock increasing. The /r/WallStreetBets is essentially a mass of people deciding to invest in a company/ share that has little value and yet the market/masses increases its value temporarily. This in my humble opinion shows the future towards democratizing wealth accumulation.</p> 

<p>     The reason why this market movement gained so much momentum within the mainstream media is because the hedge funds were negatively affected by this as they largely took short positions against GamesStop and other retailers. One particular hedge fund, <a href = "https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340"> Melvin Capital</a>, had to be bailed out by other funds because such a decision to invest in GamesStop by the masses essentially forced them into potential bankruptcy. As an Information Scientist, the idea of the masses utilizing information and computing towards democratizing wealth accumulation fascinates me. A mass of users/investors using the basic laws of supply and demand towards utilizing the market for the middle/working classes as opposed to just the Wall Street elite is incredibly appealing for me.</p>

<p>     Depending on the number of users and amount of capitol, there is the potential for a critical mass of users/capitol to be driving the headlines that we see akin to the GamesStop headlines. Should an app/investing firm be created towards using the power of the markets for generating wealth for the people who have been previously disenfranchised; I think that idea would be rather powerful. A good information science problem would be perhaps using machine learning and other statistical methods to determine what might be the most profitable stocks and utilizing this user base towards generating the type of wealth created that we see in GamesStopâ€™s rise. One of the big problems that I see in getting normal people invested in the stock market is that one requires substantial capital to enter the market as well as quite a bit of time in regards to long term investments. Day trading offers a solution in regards to the time issue and if this app/firm pooled its members capital for trading, it could leverage a much greater share of the market than just an individual investor. This theoretically would enable users to contribute a small amount of capital each day, have it pooled with the other users, and then have the algorithm day trade their money and the users could see their proportional returns at the end of the trading day. <br>
</p><br>

<p> Some things that may be nessesary for this app idea: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can put their money in at the start of the trading day</li>
  <li>"AI" algorithm day trades their money throughout the trading day, making many many trades</li>
  <li>Users get their money back plus their proportional profits at the end of the day if the day is profitable</li>
  <li> By making many many trades and using certain daytrading/investing principles along with the law of large numbers, this could be a profitable operation</li>
</ul>
